      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>
        When patchbay
        <a target='_blank' href='./introducing-patchbay.html'>launched</a>
        a few weeks ago, it was a cool idea, and even provided some useful
        primitives for connecting things over the web.  However, the API was a
        bit hacky, and the system was missing some key functionality that kept
        it from reaching its true potential.
      </p>

      <p>
        Today we're announcing patchbay 1.0. This represents a stabilization and
        normalization of the API, and exciting new features, without removing
        the simplicity and elegance that makes patchbay appealing in the first
        place.
      </p>

      <h1>What's new?</h1>

      <p>
        The most interesting example at launch was the ability to host a static
        web site using nothing but bash. It looks something like this:
      </p>

      <pre><code class='bash'>
while true; do curl https://patchbay.pub/<span class='channel'>aa7cc811-d21c-42ef-92cc-a5566fa38344</span> --data-binary ./index.html; done
      </code></pre>

      <p>
        What that does is create a producer in a loop. Consumers (such as a web
        browser) can come along and attach to the
        https://patchbay.pub/<span class='channel'>aa7cc811-d21c-42ef-92cc-a5566fa38344</span>
        channel with GET requests and receive the web page. This essentially
        lets you host static websites from your laptop, which is great for
        quickly sharing prototypes etc. However, there are a couple big
        limitations. What if you wanted to host a site with thousands of
        photos? You would have to run thousands of instance of that bash loop.
        At least one worker for each file. It's true that you can easily make
        a tool such as
        <a target='_blank' href='https://github.com/patchbay-pub/patchbay'>patchbay-cli</a>
        to automate this process, but that's still way too many open TCP
        connections. Also, what if you wanted to be able to
        <em>upload</em> images? This is impossible with the original patchbay
        because consumers can only consume, and producers can only produce.
        What we really need is to decouple consumers from GET requests, and
        make it possible for them to also POST/PUT/DELETE/etc. We also need a
        way to pass the consumer's request data (HTTP headers, query
        parameters, etc) to the producer. These features are exactly what we're
        launching today.
      </p>

      <p>
        patchbay up until now has supported 2 "protocols": pubsub and
        multi-producer/multi-consumer (MPMC) queues. The default was MPMC, and
        adding pubsub=true would switch to pubsub. Today we're adding 2
        additional protocols: requester and responder. Rather than using query
        parameters, these new protocols are accessed using "protocol routes",
        like this:
      </p>

      <pre><code class='bash'>
# Requester
curl https://patchbay.pub/req/<span class='channel'>aa7cc811-d21c-42ef-92cc-a5566fa38344</span>
# Responder
curl https://patchbay.pub/res/<span class='channel'>aa7cc811-d21c-42ef-92cc-a5566fa38344</span>
      </code></pre>

      <p>
        Splitting into 2 distinct protocols like this enables us to GET/POST
        with both requesters and responders. This essentially makes patchbay
        capable of doing anything a normal webserver can do.

      </p>

      <h2>Demos</h2>

      <p>
        Now some demos.  Note that I'm not going to explain here the details
        of how these would be made.  They require a bit more work when
        implementing the responder (though it's a lot simpler than you might
        imagine), but it's seamless for the requester, ie your browser.  Refer
        to 
        <a target='_blank' href='../docs.html#reqres'>the docs</a>
        for more information.
      </p>

      <p>
        First, consider the case of hosting a large collection of images. Here
        are some photos from Kenya and Colorado:
      </p>

      <div class='remfs-container'></div>

      <p>
        Even though there are quite a few photos, those are all being hosted
        using just a small number of shared connections to patchbay. This
        can easily scale to thousands of files (though that would require
        fancier code on the frontend to avoid having too many DOM elements
        loaded at once).
      </p>

      <p>
        Next, take a gander at the following
        <a target='_blank' href='https://durian.blender.org/'>Sintel</a>
        video, which is being served over patchbay:

        <div class='video-container'>
          <video controls>
            <source src="../files/videos/sintel-2048-surround.mp4" type="video/mp4">
            Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos.
          </video>
        </div>

        Observe that seeking to specific points in the video works just
        fine.  If you're not familiar with HTTP streaming, this is accomplished
        using
        <a target='_blank' href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Range_requests'>HTTP range requests</a>,
        which are basically just a way for an HTTP client (your browser) to say
        to the server, "Hey, I only need these specific bytes from this really
        big file". The browser then requests the file chunks around wherever
        you currently are in the video. This is done using HTTP headers.

      </p>

      <p>
        The implications of these brief examples is that anything you can do
        with a normal server, you can do with patchbay.
      </p>

      <h1>Breaking Changes</h1>

      <p>
        As of right now, patchbay supports the same API it did at launch. The
        root path / still defaults to MPMC, and pubsub=true still switches to
        the pubsub protocol. If you want to play with the new features, you
        need to use the /req/ and /res/ protocols.
      </p>

      <p>
        In order to make things more consistent and explicit, we've also added
        the /queue/ (for MPMC) and /pubsub/ protocol routes.
      </p>

      <p>
        We think it makes more sense for the root path to default to the /req/
        protocol, because it's the most generic and powerful, and the URLs
        that are most likely to be shared. For example, if you wanted to
        share the video above, the link would be

        <a target='_blank' href='https://patchbay.pub/req/stage/files/videos/sintel-2048-surround.mp4'>https://patchbay.pub/req/stage/videos/sintel-2048-surround.mp4</a>.

        Having the /req/ in there is kind of ugly.

      </p>

      <p class='emphasized'>
        With this in mind, on January 1st,
        2020, we're going to change the root path to default to /req/, instead
        of /queue/.
      </p>

      <p>
        In order to migrate current API calls, if you have a request like this:
      </p>

      <pre><code class='bash'>
curl https://patchbay.pub/<span class='channel'>aa7cc811-d21c-42ef-92cc-a5566fa38344</span>
      </code></pre>

      <p>
        You need to change it to look like this:
      </p>

      <pre><code class='bash'>
curl https://patchbay.pub/queue/<span class='channel'>aa7cc811-d21c-42ef-92cc-a5566fa38344</span>
      </code></pre>

      <p>
        We apologize for the inconvenience. The good news is that as of
        1 Jan 2020 the API will be considered 1.0, and no more breaking
        changes will be introduced without bumping the API version.
