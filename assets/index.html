  <h1>Patchwork</h1>
  <p>
    A simple communication backend for scripts and other small applications.
  </p>

  <h2>Usage</h2>
  <p>
    Patchworks data model is based on
    <a href="https://patchbay.pub">Patchbay.pub's</a> approach. The service
    provides a nearly unlimited amount of virtual "channels" represented by a
    path. Data POSTed to a channel can be received by clients doing GET
    requests, the exact behaviour depends on the type (specified with the
    "type" query parameter). The Mime content-type can also be specified with
    the "mime" query parameter.
  </p>
  <p>The available types are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>fifo/queue</strong>: Each message is received by exactly one
      receiver, if no listeners are active the server blocks until there is
      one. This is the default mode.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>pubsub</strong>: All receivers receive the published message, if
      no listeners are active the server returns "HTTP 204 NO CONTENT".
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>blockpub/blocksub</strong>: Same behaviour as pubsub, but the
      server blocks until there is at least one listener.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Authentication and Authorization</h2>
  <p>
    The server is partionend by namespaces. Each namespace has different rules
    for auth:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>/p/**</strong>: No authentication required.</li>
    <li>
      <strong>/u/{github_user}/**</strong>: Token has to be signed by a ssh
      key of the github user.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>/k/{key_fingerprint}/**</strong>: Token has to be signed by the
      ssh key with the given fingerprint.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>/w/{webcrypto_fingerprint}/**</strong>: Token has to be signed
      by the webcrypto key with the given fingerprint.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>/g/{gist_id}/**</strong>: Token has to be signed by an allowed
      signer loaded from the gist
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Token Format</h2>
  <p>
    Tokens are base64-encoded, gzipped json objects with two keys: "signature"
    and "data". The "signature" is an openssh signature of the "data". The
    "data" key is a json object with the following keys:
  </p>
  <pre>
    {
    "AllowedWritePaths": ["/some-path/*", "!/some-path/forbidden/*"],
    "AllowedReadPaths": [],
    "ValidBefore": -1,
    "ValidAfter": -1,
    }
  </pre>
  <p>
    AllowedWritePaths and AllowedReadPaths are OpenSSH style pattern lists
    (essentially a list of globs), while the ValidBefore and ValidAfter fields
    specify a unix time after/before which the token is invalid. If it's -1,
    there is no expiry.
  </p>
